The Car Dealer Management System is a database project designed to facilitate the management of a car dealership's inventory. It allows users to store and manage information about cars available for sale, including details such as name, year, selling price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, previous owners, mileage, engine specifications, power, torque, and seating capacity.
